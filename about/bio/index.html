            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Thong Huynh was born in 1997, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. At a young age, he
                usually got fascinated with everything about the world around him, from objects that were tiny in scale
                to relatively enormous in size. Those little excitements developed in Thong the love for aesthetically
                pleasing and compelling context in life.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">In 2017, Thong came to the United States to study art and design at De Anza
                College. Currently, he is working on his BFA in Digital Media Art (DMA) at San Jose State University
                (SJSU). He creates digital media artworks focusing on visual components in every aspect of life.
                Oftentimes, Thong blends the legacy of art that focuses on recalling memories into his works by
                composing the concepts he dreams of while analyzing and interacting with life elements. His works are
                notable for their attention to detail and ability to evoke sensible emotions. He considers art to be a
                skill that is accomplished through appealing design approaches by emphasizing aesthetics.</p>
