            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">My focus is centered around exploring the world, visualizing objects and
                encounters that took place in
                the past, current, or beyond the imagination, and then bringing them to life using digital media art. By
                embracing the capabilities of digital technology tools, I connect my ideas, experiences, and messages
                through observation and put them into artworks with the goal of contributing a positive entertainment
                factor to humanity and society.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">My works reflect my aspiration to create aesthetically pleasing and compelling
                designs. The themes I am
                now experimenting with include mythology/folklore and imaginative scenarios. I chose to work with the
                themes because they remind me of my younger self and a period when my fantasy could run wild as I read
                and learned about fairytales, myths, as well as the associated folklore.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">As a person who is into digital media art, I aim to bring life to the stories
                and concepts that I have always wanted to see. The delightful sensation I get from developing thought
                process to creating and having an artwork ready to share with others is, in my opinion, “invaluable;”
                hence, I hope my works inspire others to begin or continue making art from their wonderful stories and
                encounters in life.</p>
